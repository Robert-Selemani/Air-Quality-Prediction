# Air-Quality-Prediction
Air Quality Prediction with a Temporal Fusion Transformer

## About

AirQo’s air quality sensing network has more than 120 low-cost devices deployed across Uganda, which regulalry sense and report on air quality using the PM2.5 measure. In this challenge we explored using satellite radar data from Sentinel 5P to predict air quality in regions in Kampala. The use of satellite data could expand air quality predictions to areas without air quality sensor devices.

## Objective
The objective of this challenge was to predict air quality readings from AirQo’s sensors using Sentinel 5P data.
